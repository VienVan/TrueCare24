**Note

1. It is better to share to social media after user has signed up, or on Home Page rather than right at Sign Up.

2. I excluded Facebook Authorization because this is HealthCare. Users who sign up for healthcare does not want to be connected with their FaceBook.

3. Including the First Name and Last Name saves time when user signs up and proceeds to "Complete Your Profile." According to LinkedIn, progress encourages users to finish their profile. 20% progress with names filled is better than 0.

4. The "Chat With Us" Would open a dialogue modal to assist customers who need help.
