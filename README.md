**Note

1. I think it is better to have the share to social media functionality after user has signed up, or on Home Page rather than right at Sign Up.

2. Since this is healthcare, users who sign up for healthcare tend to shy away from any connections with FaceBook. I excluded the facebook OAuth on this page.

3. Including the First Name and Last Name saves time when user signs up and proceeds to "Complete Your Profile." According to LinkedIn, progress encourages users to finish their profile. 20% progress with names filled is better than 0.

4. The "Chat With Us" Would open a dialogue modal to assist customers who need help.
